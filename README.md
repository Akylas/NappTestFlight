## NappTestFlight Module for Appcelerator Titanium 

This is a Test Flight module currently based on TestFlight SDK. This module supports iOS and Android. (The android version is still in beta.)


### Download

**Find the newest version in the dist folder** 


## Notice

Testflight does not know that you are using Appcelerator Titanium. So it will come up with a message saying that it cannot find your token. Thats okay. It will still work.
